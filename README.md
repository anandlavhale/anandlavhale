### 🧠 A Bit About Me

I’m currently a second-year ENTC student at PICT, trying to figure out not just how to write better code—but how to **build things that matter**.

Over the past year, I’ve started to see software not just as assignments or projects, but as a tool to bring change. I love learning how things work, breaking them down, and slowly building them back up in my own way.

### 🔧 What I'm Learning / Working On

- Full Stack Development (React + Node + MongoDB/Firebase)
- Real-time apps that solve real problems
- APIs, automation, and backend logic
- Writing cleaner, meaningful code
- Understanding the “why” before the “how”

---

### 🛠️ Tech I’ve Been Using

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JS, React, Tailwind
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Firebase, MySQL, MongoDB
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, VS Code, Postman, Vite, Android Studio
- **APIs & Services**: Twilio, Firebase Realtime DB, SMS Parsers

### 📌 Some Projects Close to My Heart

- **EduConnect**: A teacher-student platform to simplify class schedules  
- **Investify**: A micro-investment idea where your spending habits become savings  
- **Emergency QR Alert System**: QR-based system for sending emergency alerts  
- **Teacher Schedule Manager**: For helping faculty and students stay in sync  

Most of these were built out of curiosity, some for hackathons, and a few just because I couldn’t stop thinking about the problem.

### 💭 What I Believe

- It’s okay to not know everything—what matters is **showing up** and **learning anyway**
- Tech should feel like **magic**, but be grounded in **empathy**
- Building alone is great. **Building together** is even better
- Small things done well > Big things half-finished
