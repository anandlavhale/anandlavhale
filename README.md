### 🧠 Who Am I?

I'm a third-year ENTC student at **PICT**, but more than that—I'm someone who's obsessed with the *why* behind the *what*. Whether it’s a React component or a real-world problem, I love breaking things down, understanding them inside out, and rebuilding them better.

Over the past year, I’ve stopped seeing software as just a subject—and started seeing it as a superpower. 💡

### ❤️ Projects That Mean a Lot to Me

These aren't just projects—they're ideas that kept me up at night (in a good way):

- 🔔 **EduConnect** – A teacher-student platform for organizing schedules  
- 💰 **Investify** – A micro-investment platform where *spending = saving*  
- 🆘 **Emergency QR Alert System** – A QR-based system for real-time emergency alerts  
- 🧑‍🏫 **Teacher Schedule Manager** – Keeping faculty and students in sync  

Some were built during hackathons, others during solo sprints, but all were fueled by curiosity.
