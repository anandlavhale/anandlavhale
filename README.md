### 🌱 About Me

I’m a third-year Electronics & Telecommunication student at **PICT, Pune**, driven by a simple question:  
> *"How can I use technology to make lives better?"*

Over the past year, software development has transformed from an academic subject into something personal — a way to express ideas, solve problems, and connect with people. Whether it’s building a web app, learning a new stack, or debugging late into the night — I’ve come to enjoy the process as much as the outcome.

### 🎯 What I'm Aiming For

- 🔍 **To build solutions that matter** — real-world applications that improve lives in small but meaningful ways.
- 🚀 **To keep growing** — in knowledge, in skill, in empathy.
- 🧑‍💻 **To make code accessible** — through clean writing, open-source contributions, and community sharing.
- 🌍 **To bring impact** — by combining engineering thinking with real societal needs.
- 🏢 **To earn my place at a dream workplace** — where innovation meets values. I’m deeply inspired by companies like **Google, Microsoft, and startups that are shaping the future responsibly**.

_Built with React + Node + MongoDB._
